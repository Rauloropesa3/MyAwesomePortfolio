I made 3 different HTML files along with their own css styling sheet. I added a bootstrap link to use some of their code along with  meta:vp so it could be visible on multiple devices. I also added media quiries in each one of the css style sheets so the images would adjust to preset maxwidth's(980px,768px, and 640px). I made the HTML file semantic, and I also added alt attributes just incase the images dont show or if the user is using a screen reader.
